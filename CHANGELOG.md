## July 31, 2023 - Audio Implementation

### Summary
Today we successfully implemented audio functionality in the Flappy Square game. We added sound effects for key game events including jumping, scoring points, leveling up, and game over. The implementation enhances the game experience by providing audio feedback to player actions and game state changes.

### Implementation Details

#### Loading Audio Files
- Created references to the AudioStreamPlayer nodes in the main scene:
  ```gdscript
  @onready var jump_sound = $JumpSound
  @onready var score_sound = $ScoreSound
  @onready var level_up_sound = $LevelUpSound
  @onready var game_over_sound = $GameOverSound
  ```
  
- Implemented robust file loading using AudioStreamWAV in the _ready() function:
  ```gdscript
  # Create AudioStreamWAV objects manually
  if FileAccess.file_exists(audio_dir + "jump.wav"):
      var stream = AudioStreamWAV.new()
      var file = FileAccess.open(audio_dir + "jump.wav", FileAccess.READ)
      if file:
          var buffer = file.get_buffer(file.get_length())
          stream.data = buffer
          jump_sound.stream = stream
  ```

#### Playing Sounds at Game Events
- Added jump sound when the player jumps:
  ```gdscript
  if jump_sound.stream:
      jump_sound.play()
  ```
  
- Added score sound when passing through pipes and gaining points
- Added level up sound when reaching score thresholds for level advancement
- Added game over sound when collision is detected

#### Volume Adjustment
- Reduced the volume of all sounds by approximately half using the volume_db property:
  ```gdscript
  jump_sound.volume_db = -6.0
  score_sound.volume_db = -6.0
  level_up_sound.volume_db = -6.0
  game_over_sound.volume_db = -6.0
  ```

### Challenges and Solutions

1. **Resource Loading Issues**
   - **Challenge**: Initial attempts to use preload() and load() functions resulted in "No loader found" errors.
   - **Solution**: Implemented a direct approach using AudioStreamWAV and FileAccess to manually read the binary data from audio files.

2. **Audio Volume**
   - **Challenge**: The initial implementation had audio that was too loud for comfortable gameplay.
   - **Solution**: Reduced the volume by setting volume_db to -6.0 for all audio streams, which approximately halves the perceived loudness.

### Documentation Updates

1. **README.md**
   - Added "Audio system with volume-controlled sound effects" to the Technical Details section
   - Created a new "Audio Features" section documenting the sound effects implementation and volume optimization

2. **Version Control**
   - Committed changes with the message "Add audio functionality with optimized volume levels"
   - Successfully pushed updates to the GitHub repository

The audio implementation is now complete and enhances the gameplay experience with appropriate sound feedback and comfortable volume levels.
